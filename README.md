## Description
Happy Checkin is a service that takes the inconveniences out of the hotel check-in experience while offering add-ons that enhance the hotel arrival experience.  Flight delay? Special Request? Or just prefer to skip a check in process and head straight to your room.
Happy Checkin lets you enjoy a care free process and allows you to arrive at your hotel of booking and simply grab your room key from the fron desk and get straight to your room! After creating an account and supplying your booking information, our APP lets you see your check in status in real time and notifies you when complete! 
**No more sad check-ins!**
